# ELK stack

### Setting up ELK stack using docker compose

Docker compose makes setting up the ELK stack much easier
To fetch the latest version of Elastic search, logstash and Kibana all you run the docker compose command

You can create you own docker file or use one of them available out there

Example

https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk

cd in that the source directory and run 

```
> docker compose up 
```

The above command starts kibana and elastic search at ther respective ports
