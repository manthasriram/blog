Off late I have been hearing good things about docker. So I decided to figure out what it is and figure out if we could solve some of our problems
Here are a few basics about docker

Running a docker image

```
 >docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /var/myvolume myimage
```

The above command fetches the latest image from the myimage repo from docker hub if this is not present in your local workspace
-v specifies that location of the volume

If you would like to map a local volume into your docker container you would have to mention
-v  /<local path>: <container path >

Saving a docker image

Assuming you have done some changes to your docker image you can save your changes by committing your image  
use the command

```
> docker ps to get the container id
and then run
> docker commit <container-id> myimage-1
```

* Keep in mind the contents of the volume are not saved while committing the image
