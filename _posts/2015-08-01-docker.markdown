Off late I have been hearing good things about docker. So I decided to figure out what it is and figure out if we could solve some of our problems
Here are a few basics about docker

## Installing docker in ubuntu 14.04

```bash
sudo true

sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/docker.io /usr/local/bin/docker
sudo sed -i '$acomplete -F _docker docker' /etc/bash_completion.d/docker.io

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E9
sudo sh -c "echo deb https://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main\ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lxc-docker

sudo apt-get install apparmor

echo "docker version...."
sudo docker version
```

*Docker compose*

```
# Install docker-compose
sudo sh -c "curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.4.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo sh -c "curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/1.4.2/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose > /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose"
```


## Running a docker image

```
 >docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /var/myvolume myimage
```

The above command fetches the latest image from the myimage repo from docker hub if this is not present in your local workspace
-v specifies that location of the volume

If you would like to map a local volume into your docker container you would have to mention
-v  /<local path>: <container path >

Saving a docker image

Assuming you have done some changes to your docker image you can save your changes by committing your image  
use the command

```
> docker ps to get the container id
and then run
> docker commit <container-id> myimage-1
```

* Keep in mind the contents of the volume are not saved while committing the image
